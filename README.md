# Machine Learning

This project is an assignment designed to enhance your understanding of Neural Networks and their implementation using NumPy and PyTorch. It involves implementing and training models for handwritten digit recognition (using the MNIST dataset) and clothing classification (using the Fashion-MNIST dataset).

## Overview

The assignment is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Neural Network Using NumPy
1. **Dataset**: Use the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **Objective**: Implement a neural network (multilayer perceptron) using only NumPy for operations.
3. **Key Steps**:
   - Preprocess the dataset with Min-Max normalization.
   - Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%).
   - Implement activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, softmax) and loss functions.
   - Train the neural network using gradient descent.
   - Test and evaluate the model to ensure accuracy > 80%.

### Part 2: Neural Network Using PyTorch
1. **Dataset**: Use the Fashion-MNIST dataset for clothing classification.
2. **Objectives**:
   - Train a simple fully connected neural network.
   - Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for better performance.
3. **Key Steps**:
   - Use PyTorchâ€™s DataLoader to preprocess and load data.
   - Define and train network architectures.
   - Experiment with hyperparameters to improve validation accuracy (> 80%).
   - Save predictions for the test dataset to a file named `predictions.txt`.

## Environment

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: 
  - NumPy
  - PyTorch
